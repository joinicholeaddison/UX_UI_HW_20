   <div class="THOUGHTS column3">
   <h3 class= "title roboto-normal-24px">  USER <br> RESEARCH <br></p> The first thing you must do is have a clear understanding of the problem you need to solve and why. The most important part is asking the right questions of your user, so that you can get the information you need. Then you start collecting perspectives, reactions, feedback, and ideas that help you have a clear understanding of the motivation of the user.  </h3>
   <h3 class= "title roboto-normal-24px"> QUALITIVE <br> INTERVIEWS <br></p> Questions should be open-ended and the interview should be semi-structured. You want the interview to flow on its own, you don't have to ask all the questions in order. If the answer to a question reflects another question, I will skip that question next. Most importantly an interviewer should not try to sway the participants. Instead of agreeing with the participant the interviewer should use comments like “That’s very helpful,” or “Thank you for those thoughts.”.</h3>
   <h3 class= "title roboto-normal-24px"> USER <br> EMPATHY <br></p> The most important factor is to stay true to your user research results. User empathy is about seeing the user’s perspective, identifying with them and representing them. As designers we can make choices that benefit the user or hurt them. This is challenging because we have to imagine the user's reality, and a lot of time we have to discard our own perspective and biases.</h3>
