  <h3 class= "title roboto-normal-24px"> <p>My grandfather was an artist, he could draw but his medium of choice was photography. He loved to capture our family events and random times, and now we still have catalogs of pictures to jog our memories. Now his collection of old cameras sit around my apartment as a source of inspiration.<br></p>
  <p style="color:red; font-size:30px;">“I DON'T RECALL WHEN I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO BE AN ARTIST OR WHEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH ART”<br></p>
  <p> My guess would be that art is something that was born in me. I started art school in middle school, then attended DASH (Design and Architecture Senior High, miami, fl) and there I had my first internship at the Miami Herald. Pratt Institute for college was my next stop and graduated with a B.F.A. in Communication Design. Started an internship at SEAN JOHN, thinking I would only be working in the graphics department and designing a couple of t-shirts. I end up working my way up from being an intern to being a full fledged fashion designer focused on Knitwear. Then on to Creative Director and Head Designer for other brands, which I love because it showcased my skills in Graphic design, Branding and Merchandising also.<br></p>
  <p style="font-size:30px;"> "ART IN SOME FORM HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF MY LIFE - NOW I"M ON A NEW JOURNEY- UX/UI DESIGN."<br></p>
  <p>INTEREST: ART, DESIGN, FASHION, SNEAKERS, MUSIC, ORGANIC FOODS, RESTAURANTS, WINE & SPIRTS, AND ENTERTAINMENT (TV SHOWS AND MOVIES)</p> </h3>
